# Development backlog

This file is the actionable index for the repository's ongoing development,
feature, investigation, design, and refinement work.

## Active items

### LEDGER-001 — Run controlled clean-account installation trials

- Status: Planned
- Type: Investigation
- Layer: Cross-layer
- Evidence: One fresh account installed successfully, but its final answer
  omitted recoverable friction visible during execution.
- Next check:
  - [ ] Run trial `A2` against baseline commit `688642d`.
  - [ ] Run trial `A3` against the same commit.
  - [ ] Normalize both reports using the common incident schema.
  - [ ] Classify repeated incidents as deterministic, environment-dependent,
        transient, agent-path-dependent, or unconfirmed.

### LEDGER-002 — Harden the npm cache path in fresh Work VMs

- Status: Hypothesis
- Type: Debugging
- Layer: Work VM/runtime
- Evidence: Trial `A1` encountered a permission fault at `/root/.npm` and
  recovered by switching to a writable temporary cache.
- Next check:
  - [ ] Determine whether trials `A2` and `A3` reproduce the permission fault.
  - [ ] Confirm that setting an isolated writable cache unconditionally is
        harmless across fresh VMs.
  - [ ] If confirmed, update `scripts/ensure_youtube_mcp.sh` and test a clean
        build.

### LEDGER-003 — Characterize the account skill-save fallback

- Status: Hypothesis
- Type: Investigation
- Layer: ChatGPT skill platform
- Evidence: Trial `A1` received a validation-layer response on its first save,
  then succeeded after checking reconciliation and using a metadata-first,
  two-stage update.
- Next check:
  - [ ] Capture the exact observable response in another fresh account.
  - [ ] Determine whether the first request was rejected, asynchronously
        reconciled, or packaged incorrectly.
  - [ ] Encode conditional platform-installation guidance only after the
        behavior is sufficiently characterized.

### LEDGER-004 — Add interactive Gemini quota-pool routing

- Status: In progress
- Type: Feature
- Layer: Gemini API
- Evidence: Gemini quotas are enforced per Google Cloud project. The user has
  supplied a fallback credential from another account for interactive
  continuity, but blind round-robin rotation would drain both projects and
  could create retry storms.
- Next check:
  - [ ] Add a private fallback-key credential contract.
  - [ ] Implement primary-first, project-aware failover with cooldowns.
  - [ ] Preserve every retry in one request-fingerprint cache record.
  - [ ] Mock `429`, transient `5xx`, terminal `400`, and credential failures.
  - [ ] Validate each credential once without deliberately approaching quota.
  - [ ] Keep all long-video chunks sequential by default.
